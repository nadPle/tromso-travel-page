            <h4>Why Tromsø?</h4>
            <h2 id="information">Tromsø - worth a trip up north!</h2>
            <p>
              During a trip to Scandinavia with my hubby in the summer months of
              2016 I fell in love with Tromsø, where the sun dances at midnight!
              Nestled at 69° North, this Arctic gem in Northern Norway is
              surrounded by breathtaking mountains, serene fjords, and
              delightful island getaways. In summer, it's a land where the sun
              never takes a break and the unspoiled Arctic wilderness is just a
              stone's throw away from the city's vibrant culture.
              <br /><br />From nature's embrace by day to the city's lively beat
              by night, it's all seamlessly woven together there. You can dive
              into a kaleidoscope of experiences, whether you're chasing
              nature's wonders or savoring the local culture, food, and the
              pulsating nightlife. With a great variety of activities, there's
              something to delight every adventurer!
