          <h4>Why Tromsø?</h4>
          <h2 id="information">Tromsø - worth a trip up north!</h2>
        <p>
          During a trip to Scandinavia with my hubby in the summer months of 2016 I
          fell in love with Tromsø, where the sun dances at midnight! Nestled at 69°
          North, this Arctic gem in Northern Norway is surrounded by breathtaking mountains,
          serene fjords, and delightful island getaways. In summer, it's a land
          where the sun never takes a break. The unspoiled Arctic wilderness is just
          a stone's throw away from the city's vibrant culture. <br><br>From nature's
          embrace by day to the city's lively beat by night, it's all seamlessly
          woven together there. You can dive into a kaleidoscope of experiences,
          whether you're chasing nature's wonders or savoring the local culture,
          food, and the pulsating nightlife. With a great variety of activities,
          there's something to delight every adventurer!
