    <h4 id="information">Tromsø - worth a trip up north!</h4>
    <p>
      During a trip to Scandinavia with my hubby in the summer months of 2016 I
      fell in love with Tromsø, where the sun dances at midnight! Nestled at 69°
      North, this Arctic gem in Northern Norway is surrounded by breathtaking mountains,
      serene fjords, and delightful island getaways. In summer, it's a land
      where the sun never takes a break. The unspoiled Arctic wilderness is just
      a stone's throw away from the city's vibrant culture. From nature's
      embrace by day to the city's lively beat by night, it's all seamlessly
      woven together there. You can dive into a kaleidoscope of experiences,
      whether you're chasing nature's wonders or savoring the local culture,
      food, and the pulsating nightlife. With a great variety of activities,
      there's something to delight every adventurer!
